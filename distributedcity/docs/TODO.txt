SOME DISTRIBUTEDCITY TODOS.


Design / Scalability Issues:

- Top Priority for 1.1!

  Use single complex queries to gather comment totals rather
  than multiple looping queries.  Same for other looping queries.
  'Forum Top' page does _way_ too many queries.  
  A good goal: 5 DB queries per requested page.  
  
  This might require structuring the data differently for more 
  efficient retrieval.

- database layer should be cleanly separated from application layer
  with a small and well documented API.  Nice if all DB queries
  are in a single file or well defined set of files.

- All user data should be stored in the Database.  There should
  not be any disk storage for keys (or anything else) required.
  This provides for easier backup/restore and for using multiple
  web servers with a single DB.
  
- identify any DB queries that may happen more than once in a given
  request and cache them in memory.
  
- user text display is an inefficient multi-pass process to translate
  all the URLs, bold, etc.  Each string is processed several times.  
  It should be re-written as a single pass with a decent parser / state 
  engine.
  

Maintenance Issues:

- DB schema should use foreign keys to ensure data integrity.

- DB schema should use NOT NULL fields and other check constraints.

- Get rid of dba/gdbm cacheing code. This code is buggy and causes
  "driver initialization failed" messages to appear intermittently on
  the displayed web pages.

- presentation layer should be cleanly separated from application logic.
  There should not be any human language specific strings in the code.
  
- error codes and strings should be defined apart from the code.

- The way comment types and article types are differentiated is bad and
  requires lots of redundant special case code.
  
- application should be more modular.  too much spaghetti code and
  inter-dependencies.


Cool New Features We Could Add:

- Signup payment mechanism via DBC, ALTA

- Referral process

- Generic DC Registration/Username Server

- Additional Services for the sovereign individual / perpetual traveller / developer,
  tied together via registration server:
  
   - squid proxy server

   - nntp server (newsgroups)
   - cvs server, subversion
   - mail server (secure pop, imap)
   - mixmaster anon mail sending
   - ssh (shell)
   - DB access (postgres, mysql)
   - PGP key server
   - jabber server
   - bugzilla

- Java IIP Chat applet

- Weblogs optionally visible on non ssl site and/or to
  non logged in (guest) visitors

- Upload your own nym picture

- Full text search
