<c>Accounts
<q>What is a Nym?
<a>A Nym is your online identity. Pronounced NIHM, bring a shortened form of 'pseudo-nym', this is a unique name and associated OpenPGP key within Distributed City. A Nym has a reputation attached and is used by you to build up reputation capital.
Nyms and associated reputation are a foundation upon which a whole new market and sphere of multinational business
that would otherwise be impractical will be based.
<BR>
Other items are associated with your Nym, such as a Nym Image (or 'Avatar') and Profile information for example outside email address, web page, interests, DMT (ALTA) claim number for making payments may also be attached to your Distributed City Nym (See: Profile) below.



<c>Accounts
<q>Can I apply the reputation I've built up with my Distributed City Nym outside of Distributed City?
<a>Not yet, but we're working with other service providers to make this happen. Notable efforts in this area include www.WebofTrust.org.

<c>Accounts
<q>Can I change my Nym?
<a>No. It is bound to your OpenPGP public key. If you want a different Nym you must create a new account.

<c>Accounts
<q>I forgot or lost my password, can you send it to me please?
<a>No. The only way for us to verify who you are is for you to enter in the correct password. So don't lose your password.

<c>Accounts
<q>But you don't understand, I cannot access my Distributed City account because I lost my password, how can I get in if I can't remember my password and you won't send it to me?
<a>You must create a new account.

<c>Accounts
<q>I forgot or lost my passphrase for my OpenPGP key. I cannot access my private messages.
<a>Sadly, we can't help you there either.

<c>Accounts
<q>How long does my session last?
<a>Currently sessions timeout after 60 minutes of no activity, or until you press the LOGOUT button, in which case the session is destroyed immediately. If you let your session expire, after 60 minutes you will need to log back in again. We will allow this timeout setting to be customized in future releases.

<c>Categories

<a>Categories are the highest level tag for marking content within DC. All content in News or the Forums belongs to at least one category. There are a handful of them.

<c>Categories
<q>What are Topics?
<a>Topics are a more fine grain tag for organizing content, also belonging to a higher level category. There are many topics to choose from. 
<c>Categories
<q>I am still confused. What is the difference between a Category and a Topic?
<a>Take a look at the Categories and Topics in the <a href="/forums/">Forums</a> or <a href="/news/">News</a> and the difference will become more clear. Both allow you to quickly identify if a 
news article or forum post might be of interest to you.



<c>News
<q>What is the <a href="/news/">News</a>?
<a>The News is the 'front page' of Distributed City. Users submit stories for the front page from their personal Weblogs (see: Weblogs) and also make comments about stories submitted.

<q>Can I submit comments for a particular news story?
<a>Yes, click on the 'Read More' link under the story lead in and enter your succinct and relevant comments on the breaking news,

<c>Private Messaging
<q>What is <a href="/messaging/">Messaging</a>?
<a>Private messaging allows you to send a private message instantly to another Distrubuted City user. Private Messages are encrypted by default using OpenPGP.
<BR>
Each Distributed City user has their own OpenPGP key which allows automatic and transparent OpenPGP encryption of messages within Distributed City.

<c>Private Messaging
<q>Can I use my OpenPGP key outside of Distributed City?
<a>You can view your public key from the <a href="/user/settings/">User Settings</a> page by clicking on 'OpenPGP'. At the moment however, the only way to receive a message encrypted to it is from another user within Distributed City.



<c>Chat
<q>What is <a href="/chat/">Chat</a>?
<a>Chat is for quick temporary conversations using iiP (the Invisible IRC Project). This is like the popular IRC chat client, except enhanced for privacy over an encrypted connection.



<c>Weblogs
<q>What is a <a href="/weblogs/">Weblog/BLOG</a>?
<a>A Weblog is a web page made up of usually
 short, frequently updated posts that are arranged chronologically --<BR>
 like a what's new page or a journal. The content and purpose of<BR>
 Weblog varies greatly -- from links and commentary about other web<BR>
 sites, to news about a company/person/idea, to diaries, photos,<BR>
 poetry, mini-essays, project updates, even fiction.
<BR>
 Many Weblogs are personal, "what's on my mind" type musings. Others are
 collaborative efforts based on a specific topic or area of mutual
 interest. Some Weblogs are for play. Some are for work. Some are both.
 <BR>
 When you create your Weblog here at Distributed City the content is entirely up to you.

<c>Weblogs
<q>What are Weblogs good for?
<a>Weblogs are also excellent team/community/company/family communication
 tools. They help small groups communicate in a way that is simple
 and more easy to follow than email or discussion forums.<BR>
 A Weblog can help keep everyone in the loop,
 promote cohesiveness and group culture, and provide an informal
 "voice" of a project or department to outsiders.
<BR>
Weblogs are also good for making submissions to the News frontpage. We want your content submissions!
