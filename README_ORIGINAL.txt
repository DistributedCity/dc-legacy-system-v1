Installing the Distributed City Project code

  The Distributed City system is made up of two separate systems:

  The WWW Frontend:  This is the php web application
  Follow the instructions in www.distributedcity.com/doc/INSTALL.txt to install the frontend system.
 
  The XMLRPC Backend: Essentially the DC webservice. 
  Follow the instructions in xmlrpc.distributedcity.com/doc/INSTALL.txt to install the frontend system.

  If you have access to a backend DC XMLRPC webservice you can install just the frontend and have at it.

  There is no fancy-schmancy install scripts at this time. If you have
  the time, why don't you contribute one! :)
