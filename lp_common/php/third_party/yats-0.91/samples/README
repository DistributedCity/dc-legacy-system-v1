These samples are very simplistic and utterly devoid of style. They are also a
bit incomplete.  Feel free to contribute your own samples if you come up with
better ones.

For each sample<x>.php there is a corresponding sample<x>.tmpl that is loaded
by the php file. This is done for the sake of simplicity.

In real life usage, the goal is often to make the template independent of 
the code.  Thus, you would probably do something like have the core code 
in separate file(s), and then have a front-end php file that references 
the core code and also determines which template to use.  Eg, it could 
detect the user agent and decide to use the IE template, the mozilla 
template, the handheld template, and so on.  Or it could use a special 
getvar in the URL, such as tmpl=sometemplate.  Or it could even be based 
on a user preference, or on and on...  

That part is left as an exercise for the reader.

Have a nice day.
